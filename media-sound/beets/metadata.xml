		The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for
		all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata
		as it goes. It then provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and
		accessing your music.

		Because beets is designed as a library, it can do almost anything you
		can imagine for your music collection. Via plugins, beets becomes a
		panacea:
		* Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need:
			album art, lyrics, genres, tempos, ReplayGain levels, or
			acoustic fingerprints.
		* Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, and Beatport. Or guess
			metadata using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.
		* Transcode audio to any format you like.
		* Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums
			that are missing tracks.
		* Clean up crufty tags left behind by other, less-awesome tools.
		* Embed and extract album art from files' metadata.
		* Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play
			it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.
		* Analyze music files' metadata from the command line.
		* Listen to your library with a music player that speaks the MPD
			protocol and works with a staggering variety of interfaces.

		If beets doesn't do what you want yet, writing your own plugin is
		shockingly simple if you know a little Python.
